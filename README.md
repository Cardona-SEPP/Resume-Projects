# Resume Projects

This repository contains SQL projects I created to demonstrate my data analysis and business analytics skills.

Each project focuses on answering real-world business questions using SQL, with an emphasis on:
-- data aggregation
-- business metrics
-- analytical thinking
-- clean, readable queries

## Project 1: Department Salary Cost Analysis

### Business Question

- Measure each department's percentage of total payroll
- Rank departments by payroll cost

### Metrics Produced
- Total department salary cost
- Employee headcount
- Average salary per employee
- Percentage of total payroll
- Payroll ranking

### SQL Skills Demonstrated
- JOINs (LEFT JOIN)
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Window functions
- Ranking functions
- NULL handling with COALESCE
- Business metric construction

## Notes
These projects focus on analytical logic and business insights rather than dashboards and visualization.
More SQL analysis projects, Excel datacleaning/analysis projects, and Excel dashboards are being developed as a follow-up layer.
